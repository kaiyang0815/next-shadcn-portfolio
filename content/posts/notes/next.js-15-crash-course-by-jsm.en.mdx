## 00:05:25 — Next.js Benefits

the ebook

### client vs server components

The architecture of Next.js originally react and it have two types of components, the client component which runs in user's browser and server component which runs on the server, this concept was supported by react 19 released.The Next.js is the first to adopt server componet and fully utilizes it, all component you create automatically converts to server component unless you specifically instructed not to.

### the handler of rendering

The react 19 supports server components choose the way it handles rendering.It can optimize the performance when you visit a page which server has full rendered.

And the serch engine could crawl and index the websites.

### routing and file-based system

The Next.js doesn't require installing a separate routing package and it use file-based routing, each folder's name will becames the route segement and the page in folder will render the html.

Use this system, Next.js support backend api develop, this means it can create an api endpoint by simply creating a file called route inside a folder call whichever you want.

### auto code split

The Next.js automates code splitting by default, it can speed up page load times.

### optimization, like font image script og

The Next.js provides font optimization reduce the loading time by pre-loading font files.

The image optimization automatically compresses images and applies lazy loading.

The script optimization optimizes third party scripts.

> The Next.js support Font, Image, Script component for these optimizations.

## 00:10:55 — Next.js Theory & Practical

### CLI

npx create-next-app@latest
all options set default

### The project structure

#### tsconfig.json

The configuration file for typescript it defines what should be type checked ignored and the rules to follow next

#### tailwind.config.ts

#### postcss.config.mjs

The configuration file for postcss, a tool used to process CSS with different plugins.

#### next.config.ts

Config Next.js features such as experimental options image settings.

and more

#### public folder

Contains static assets always put images and other static data here.

#### app folder

### React Server Components

why not all

### React Client Components

directive "use client"

server-side prerendering

when to use client component

### Routing

file-based system

nested routes

#### Dynamic routes

Dynamic routing in Next.js allows part of the URL to change based on user input or specific data from a database. To create a dynamic route, wrap the dynamic part of the URL in square brackets.

### Layouts

root layout

route layout

### Route Groups

The Route Group allow you to organize your route segments and project structure without impacting the URL path, this means that you can create folders but unlike nested routes they won't show up in the URL you do that by wrapping the folder name inside parentheses.

### Error handing

error.tsx

global-error.tsx

### Loading UIs

loding.tsx

### Data fetching

Auto request dulplicate

Keep senceitive sercurity

### SSG

### ISR

time based validate

### SSR

### PPR

it's a new rendering model that combines static and dynamic rendering it allows you to render a static shell of a page while streaming Dynamic content.

### API Routes

### Search Engine Optimization(SEO)

metadata config based, generateMetadata, file-based
